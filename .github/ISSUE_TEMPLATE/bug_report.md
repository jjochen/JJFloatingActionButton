<!--
Hi, thanks so much for opening an issue! ü§ó

To better pinpoint (and solve) the issue you're experiencing, we could use some information on your behalf.

In some cases it can be really helpful to provide a short example of your code.
If so, please wrap these code blocks in backticks, like this:

```swift
*your code goes here*
```

The code will automatically get its syntax highlighted, and doesn't need to be indented 4 spaces to be shown as code.

When referencing a dependency manager-related issue (CocoaPods, SwiftPM), please add its configuration file and version to the issue.
It would be helpful to put the contents in a code block too, using ```ruby for CocoaPods and ```swift for SwiftPM.
