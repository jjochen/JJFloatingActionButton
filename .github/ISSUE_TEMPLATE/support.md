What can we help you with?

In some cases it can be really helpful to provide a short example of your code.
If so, please wrap these code blocks in backticks, like this:

```swift
*your code goes here*
```

The code will automatically get its syntax highlighted, and doesn't need to be indented 4 spaces to be shown as code.
